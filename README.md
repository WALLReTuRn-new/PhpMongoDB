# Project PHP MongoDB
PHP and MongoDB with SQL-Style Querying
This is a README.md guide for a project that utilizes PHP and MongoDB, providing SQL-style queries executed on MongoDB.

Project Description
This project is built using PHP and utilizes MongoDB for data storage. While MongoDB uses its own query language, this project provides a translation of typical PHP queries into a SQL-like format that can be executed on MongoDB.

Included Queries
The project includes translations of the following typical PHP queries into SQL-style queries that can be executed on MongoDB:

SELECT: A query for selecting data from a MongoDB collection, resembling the SELECT statement in SQL.

INSERT: A query for inserting data into a MongoDB collection, resembling the INSERT statement in SQL.

UPDATE: A query for updating data in a MongoDB collection, resembling the UPDATE statement in SQL.

DELETE: A query for deleting data from a MongoDB collection, resembling the DELETE statement in SQL.


/ - Show Based Query Result

/insert.php - Insert Single

/insertmany.php - Insert Many

/update.php - Update Single //Have Where

/updatemany.php - Update Many //Have Where

/delete.php - Delete Single //Have Where

/deletemany.php - Delete Many //Have Where


Environment Setup
To set up the development environment for this project, follow these steps:

Install PHP: Download and install PHP on your computer. You can find installation instructions for your specific operating system on the official PHP website.

Install MongoDB: Install MongoDB on your computer by following the instructions provided in the official MongoDB documentation. Make sure you have a running MongoDB instance that your PHP application can connect to.

Clone the Project: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git or download the project source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

Configure MongoDB Connection: In the project directory, locate the configuration files such as config.php or .env file and update the MongoDB connection settings (hostname, port, credentials, etc.) according to your local setup.

Start the Application: Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is set up, you can start the PHP application by running the following command in the project directory:

Copy code
php -S localhost:8000
This command starts a PHP development server that listens on localhost at port 8000. You can access the application in your web browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000.

Testing
To test the application, you can manually perform queries using the provided SQL-style MongoDB query translations. Use the familiar SQL syntax to execute queries on MongoDB and verify the results.

Additionally, you can create automated tests using PHP testing frameworks like PHPUnit to ensure the correctness and functionality of the queries.

Make sure you have a separate testing environment or utilize testing frameworks to ensure the integrity and reliability of your application.
